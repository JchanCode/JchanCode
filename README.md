  Hi, I‚Äôm Jonas Chan, a recent Software Engineering Bootcamp graduate amid a necessary career change. 
I‚Äôve cooked in some of the most demanding Michelin star kitchens, proudly creating damn delicious food for New Yorkers for the past decade.
During this time, I have grown leaps and bounds as a person, chef, and leader.
  I‚Äôm happily engaged and planning to start a family with my fiancee. But as a Chef, It‚Äôs near impossible to find a healthy work/life balance. 
Imagine missing out on most of your children‚Äôs ‚Äúfirst‚Äù because of work demands or working on big holidays instead of spending time with family at home. 
My priority has shifted from my younger days. As easy as following my passion neck-deep into the culinary world, now I‚Äôm plunging headfirst into the exciting world of coding. I have no plans on going back.
  My nine months in Springboard were challenging, I‚Äôm not going to lie, but I firmly believe I have what it takes to become a developer. I‚Äôve learned a ton in Springboard, from frontend and backend development to databases, data structures, and algorithms. With urgency, I continue to build upon my foundation from Springboard, further developing my coding skills, expanding my network, and creating new projects.
