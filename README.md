I'm an Application Engineer I at Vanguard, doing front-end and back-end work for our clients to help plan and track their retirement and financial goals. It's a challenging space to work in; we are dealing with people's life saving after all. But we still work hard at giving the client what they want plus a little more. They don't always like it but building the logic and tweaking the stylesheets is where you'll find me.
â€ƒBefore being a Developer, I was a Sous Chef at some of the best restaurants in NYC, either pretending to know what I was doing or trying not to burn things. Still, one thing for sure is that I was always working hard.
â€ƒIt's a tough transition, it's hard, but lessons from the kitchen have guided me every day as a developer. I'm nowhere near where I want to be yet, but craft takes time. And here's the page to that document that journey.
